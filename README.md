## About Me:

I am a Unity game developer with nearly 1 year of experience.

I work confidently with C# and Unity, applying architectural approaches (ECS) and design patterns such as:

[Singleton, Factory, Observer, State, Strategy, Object Pool, Event Based, Template Method, Entry Point, Services, Service Locator, Dependency Injection, and Scriptable Objects.]

I actively use third-party tools and plugins including: DOTween, UniTask, Shader Graph, AssetBundles, Addressables, DOTS, NetCode
