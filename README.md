## About Me:

I am a Unity game developer with nearly 1 year of experience.

I work confidently with C# and Unity, applying architectural approaches (MVC) and design patterns such as:

[Singleton, Factory, Observer, State, Object Pool, Event Bus, Service Locator, Dependency Injection, and Scriptable Objects.]

I actively use third-party tools and plugins including: 🛠️ DOTween, UniTask, 📦 AssetBundles, Addressables.
